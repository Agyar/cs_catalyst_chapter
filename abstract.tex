\abstract{
The volume of data produced by numerical simulations performed on high
performance computers is becoming increasingly large. The visualization of
these large post-generated volumes of data is currently a bottleneck for the
realization of engineering and physics studies in industrial environments. In
this context, Catalyst is a prototype in-situ visualization library developed by
Kitware to help reduce the data post-treatment overhead. Additionally,
\CS is a Computational Fluid Dynamics code developed by EDF, one of the
largest electricity producers in Europe, for its large scale simulations. Both
Catalyst and \CS are open-source software. In this
chapter we present a case study where Catalyst is coupled with \CS. We
evaluate the feasibility and performance of this integration by running several
use cases in one of our corporate supercomputers.
