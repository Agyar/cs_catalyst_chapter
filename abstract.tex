Numerical simulations using supercomputers are producing an increasingly larger
volume of data to be visualized. In this context, Catalyst is a prototype In-Situ
visualization library developed by Kitware to help reduce the data
post-treatment overhead. On the other side, Code\_Saturne is a Computational
Fluid Dynamics code used at Eléctricité de France (EDF), one of the biggest electricity producers in
Europe, for its large scale numerical simulations. In this article we present a study
case where Catalyst is integrated into Code\_Saturne. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of this integration by running two
test cases in one of our corporate supercomputers.
