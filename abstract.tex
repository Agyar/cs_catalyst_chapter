\abstract{
The volume of data produced by numerical simulations performed on high
performance computers is becoming increasingly large. The visualization of these
large post-generated volumes of data is currently a bottleneck for the
realization of engineering and physics studies in industrial environments. In
this context, Catalyst is a prototype in-situ visualization library developed by
Kitware to help reduce the data post-treatment overhead. On the other side, 
\CS is a Computational Fluid Dynamics code used at EDF, one of the biggest
electricity producers in Europe, for its large scale simulations. In this
chapter we present a study case where Catalyst is integrated into \CS.
We evaluate the feasibility and performance of this integration by running
several use cases in one of our corporate supercomputers.
