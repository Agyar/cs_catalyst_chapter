\section{Code\_Saturne: A Computational Fluid Dynamics code}
\label{sec:cs}
Code\_Saturne is an open source computational fluid dynamics software designed
to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the cases of 2D, 2D axisymmetric or 3D
flows. Its main module is designed for the simulation of flows which may be
steady or unsteady, laminar or turbulent, incompressible or potentially
dilatable, isothermal or not. Scalars and turbulent fluctuations of scalars can
be taken into account. The code includes specific modules, referred to as
“specific physics”, for the treatment of lagrangian particle tracking,
semi-transparent radiative transfer, gas combustion, pulverised coal
combustion, electricity effects (Joule effect and electric arcs) and
compressible flows. Code\_Saturne relies on a finite volume discretisation and
allows the use of various mesh types which may be hybrid (containing several
kinds of elements) and may have structural non-conformities (hanging nodes).The
parallelization is based on standard spatial decomposition with ghost cells
that facilitate data passing between adjacent cells lying across the boundaries
of disconnected decomposed parts using the Message Passing Interface. More
technical details are presented in~\cite{cs2004} and ~\cite{userguide}.
